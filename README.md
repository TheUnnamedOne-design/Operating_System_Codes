## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the implementations in this repository, you can clone it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheUnnamedOne-design/Operating_System_Codes.git
```

## 🔧 Compilation & Execution

Each algorithm is implemented in a specific programming language (C/C++/Python). You can compile and run the programs as follows:

For **C/C++ Programs**:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```

For **C++ Programs**:

```bash
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```

For **Python Scripts**:

```bash
python3 program.py
```
